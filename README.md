# Fantasy Governance Ireland 🐝

Build your ideal Irish government with the right people for the right jobs. Inspired by "The Paul Principle" - the idea that Ireland has many competent experts who would be better suited to governance than traditional politicians.

## 🌟 The Paul Principle

> "There are many 'Pauls' in Irish life - competent people with track records who would be much better suited to particular postings than the traditional political class."

Named after Paul Handrick (The Bee Guy), who created Ireland's first native wild bee sanctuary and advocates for practical biodiversity solutions. The concept highlights how Ireland's communities are full of experts with proven track records who could transform governance.
